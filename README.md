### Motivation

Two months ago, we researched the current state of business operations and the competition for users is getting more and more fierce. And the problems are becoming more and more obvious as people start to manage their customers on WhatsApp. There is no good solution to the problem.
 -  The company has been attracting a high number of customers across all channels, but no high active users remain.
 -  It cannot achieve refined operations. 
 - The management of customers is inefficient and there is no standardized process.

So we decided to build an intelligent, automated CRM for companies operating customers. It eliminates the need for header enterprises to manually manage data and allows them to spend as little time and effort as possible on CRM.
